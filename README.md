# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Hello! This is a project from TOP.

Consists of playing rock, paper, scissors with the computer.

Initially, it will be played through the console.

Further update will include a graphic interface.

Game info:

The game is a slight variation of rock paper scissors based on one 
of my favorite tv shows.

Rules: 

Water beats Earth
Earth beats Fire
Fire beats Air
Air beats Water

Same element is a tie

Water v. Fire is a tie (opposite elements are tie)
Air v. Earth is a tie (opposite elements are tie)

As you might have guessed, yes! This is the rock paper scissor version from ATLA.
If you are wondering whats the logic behind which elements beats who,
the answer is simplle, its based in the avatar cycle; as you may remember from
the intro: "Water, Earth, Fire, Air"
